This is a code test

The app is built in React. It fetches its data from SWAPI and displays the content first in a List view page and then on a Detail view page using React Router. It saves the calls in a simple cache function that is called useFetch.
It's repsonsive after the mobile first doctrine, but could improve a lot with more time spent on it.

Run npm start or see it live here: https://starwars-dating.netlify.app/
